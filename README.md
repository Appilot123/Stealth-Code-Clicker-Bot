<h1 align="center">Stealth Code Clicker Bot</h1>

## Project Overview:

This lightweight automation bot is built to mimic human behavior while performing a simple yet critical task: clicking a button on a website at specific intervals to generate a code, then logging that code either locally or into a Google Sheet. It’s designed to operate undetected—ideal for use cases where automation cloaking is a must. The tool solves a niche need: trigger-time precision with stealth, making it perfect for time-based reward systems, booking windows, or daily claim actions.


## Core Features:
- **Undetectable Behavior:** Mimics human input via randomized delays, viewport simulation, and natural cursor movement to avoid bot detection.
- **Scheduled Action Execution:** Triggers button clicks at fixed or randomized intervals using background timers and error-handled task loops.
- **Flexible Data Logging:** Easily logs output to local files (JSON/CSV) or directly into a Google Sheet via API integration.
